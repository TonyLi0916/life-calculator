        <p id="msg">&copy; A tip or gratuity is an additional payment for services. 
            Customs vary globallyâ€”while tipping is expected in places like the U.S., where servers often rely on tips to meet minimum wage, 
            it can be offensive in countries like Japan, where it's seen as disrespectful. In some places, gratuity may even be automatically added to bills.
            As a tourist, researching local tipping practices can help ensure appreciation is shown appropriately.
